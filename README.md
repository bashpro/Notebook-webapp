# Notebook-webapp
 A webapp that lets you take notes in a preferred writing style (inspired by Jade/pug)

 So far we only have the UI which is 90% done but will surely need a lot of improvement
 UI ver 0.0.1

----
 
## what is left to do
1. create elements(div) and styles for the notes.
2. functional note.
3. js for note ID.
4. notebook menu/settings (adding ID's for the system).
5. notes.html to store the information.
6. import elements in ui.html.
7. link notes to find/search engin.
8. js for changing notebooks.
9. option/menu for notes (having the ability to pin to top or edit/delete notes.).
10. animation sequence for find section.
11. finish layout of profiles/settings menu.
> theres a lot more to do but this will be the main focus for now!
